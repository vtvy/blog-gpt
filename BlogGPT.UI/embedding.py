text = """Drop the gold into a jug of water to see if it sinks. Get a container big enough to hold both the water and the gold youd like to test. The water temperature you use doesnt really matter, so lukewarm water is fine. Real gold is a dense metal, so it falls directly to the bottom of the jug. Imitation gold is much lighter and floats.\r\nReal gold also doesnt rust or tarnish when wet, so if you see a discoloration, you probably have plated gold. Put a few drops of vinegar on the gold. Set your jewelry or gold piece onto a flat surface. Use an eyedropper to apply a bit of vinegar and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Real gold wont change color, but fake gold will.\r\nYou can also submerge the gold in a glass container with vinegar for 15 minutes. This is a slightly riskier method because vinegar might damage semi-precious stones on gold jewelry. Find any noticeable discolorations where the gold has worn away. Gold is pretty soft for a metal, so plated gold often rubs away over time. The best places to check are around the edges of jewelry and coins. These spots often rub up against your skin and clothing throughout the day. If you see a different metal underneath the gold, you know your item is plated and not considered real gold.\r\nFor example, a silver coloring might indicate silver or titanium. A red coloring could mean copper or brass. Note any discolorations on your skin from wearing or holding the gold. Pure gold doesnt react with sweat or oil from your skin, so if you see black or green marks, they are from other metals. Silver leaves behind black marks and copper leaves behind green marks. If you see a lot of these marks on your skin, your gold may be less pure than you expect.\r\nKeep in mind that most gold items are blends of gold and other metals. Even something like a 14K piece of jewelry, 58.3% gold, can leave these marks. Use other tests as well to ensure your gold is authentic. Hold a strong magnet up to see if the gold sticks to it. For this test, you need a strong magnet capable of pulling even metal blends. Move the magnet over the gold and observe how it reacts. Gold isnt magnetic, so dont be fooled by anything that sticks. If the magnet pulls the gold toward it, your item is either impure or a fake.\r\n\r\nRegular kitchen magnets might not be strong enough. For better accuracy, buy a powerful neodymium magnet from a home improvement store.\r\nThe magnet test isnt foolproof, since counterfeit gold can be made with non-magnetic metal like stainless steel. Also, some genuine gold items are made with magnetic metals such as iron. Rub the gold on unglazed ceramic to see if it leaves a streak. Make sure youre using an unglazed piece of ceramic since anything with a glaze could affect the test results. Drag your item across the plate until you see some fragments coming off the gold. If you see a black streak, that means your gold is not real. A gold streak usually indicates authentic gold.\r\n\r\nTry getting an unglazed ceramic tile or a plate online or from your local home improvement store.\r\nThis test scratches the gold a little bit but doesnt typically leave much noticeable damage. It is much safer than other tests involving scratches or acid.\r\nAnother way to do this is by spreading some cosmetic foundation on your skin and dragging the gold across it after it dries. Fake gold usually reacts with the foundation, leaving a green or black streak in it. Look for an official number marking on the gold. The marking, or hallmark, tells you the percentage of gold in an item. The hallmark is often printed on jewelry clasps or the inner bands of rings. It is usually visible on the surface of coins and bullion. The stamp is a number from 1 to 999 or 0K to 24K depending on what kind of grading system was used.\r\n\r\nUse a magnifying glass to help you identify the hallmark. It can be tough to make out by eye, especially on smaller pieces of gold such as rings.\r\nOlder pieces of jewelry may not have visible hallmarks. Sometimes the hallmark wears off over time, while in other cases the jewelry never got a stamp. Hallmarking became common in the 1950s in some areas, but in India for instance, it only became mandatory in the year 2000. Use the number marking to determine how much gold is in your piece. Most coins and jewelry are not pure gold, so they have other metals mixed in. There are 2 different scales used to indicate this through the hallmark. The number rating system used in Europe runs from 1 to 999 with 999 meaning pure gold. The U.S. uses a scale from 0 to 24K, where 24K is pure gold.\r\n\r\nThe number rating system is easier to read than the karat rating system. For example, a rating of 375 means your item consists of 37.5% gold.\r\nWhat number means gold depends on the country you are in. In the U.S., for example, anything 9K and under is not considered to be gold, even though a 9K bracelet consists of 37.5% gold.\r\nCounterfeit pieces may have markings making them look authentic, so dont go solely on the hallmark unless youre certain you are holding gold. Check for a letter marking indicating that the gold isnt pure. Some of the common letters you may see are GP, GF, and GEP. These letters indicate that your gold piece is plated, which means the maker put a thin layer of gold over another metal, such as copper or silver. Your item has some gold in it, but it isnt considered real gold.\r\n\r\nGP stands for gold plated, GF means gold filled, and GEP means gold electroplate.\r\nThe markings vary a little depending on where the gold is from. For instance, gold from India contains a small triangle symbol indicating the government council responsible for the rating system. It then has a number rating and a letter code, such as K, for the jeweler. Weigh your piece of gold on a scale. If you have a decent kitchen scale, place the gold on it. Otherwise, jewelers and appraisers often can do it for you for free. Call around to different jewelry or appraisal stores to see which ones offer this service. Make sure you get the weight in grams rather than ounces.\r\nYou need the weight in grams to use in a calculation later. If the weight is in ounces, you wont get an accurate result. Fill a graduated cylinder halfway full with water. Choose a cylinder that is big enough to hold the gold. It needs to have measurement markings in milliliters (mL) or cubic centimeters (cc). If you dont have a regular graduated cylinder, you could try using a kitchen measuring cup.\r\n\r\nVials with frequent millimeter markings on the side are useful for getting a more accurate measurement during the test.\r\nThe amount of water you use doesnt matter that much as long as you leave plenty of space for the gold. If you fill the vial to the top, dropping the gold into it causes the water to spill. Read the starting water level in the cylinder. Look at the markings on the cylinder, then record the water level. This measurement is very important for the test, so write it down. Make sure you have the vial on a flat, level surface in order to get as accurate a reading as possible.\r\nKeep in mind that it doesnt matter if your vial is marked in milliliters or cubic centimeters. They are the same measurement, so either unit can be used in the test. Drop the gold into the vial and record the new water level. Gently lower the gold into the cylinder to avoid losing any of the water. Let go of it right above the water to prevent splashing or getting your fingers wet. Then, read the markings again to get the second measurement.\r\nWrite the second measurement down on a piece of paper. Note that this is the second measurement, not the initial one. Subtract the measurements to find the difference in the water level. To figure out how much water the gold displaced, subtract the initial measurement (the smaller number) from the final measurement. This gives you an answer in milliliters or cubic centimeters, depending on what measurement your vial lists.\r\nFor example, if you started with 17 mL (0.57  fl oz) of water that rose to 18 mL (0.61  fl oz), that leaves a 1 mL (0.034  fl oz) difference. Divide the golds weight by the difference in the water level. The density of the gold equals its mass divided by its volume. After calculating the density, compare the result to the standard density of gold, which is 19.3 g/mL. If your number is way off, chances are you have a fake. Keep in mind, though, that some combinations of metals in fake gold can have a density similar to real gold.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you have a gold item that weighs 38 g (1.3 oz) and displaces 2 mL (0.068  fl oz) of water. Divide 38 by 2 to get 19 g/mL, which is very close to the density of gold.\r\nThe standard density differs a little depending on the type of gold you have. For 14k yellow gold, its about 12.9 to 13.6 g/mL. For 14K white gold, its around 14 g/mL.\r\nA piece of 18K yellow gold has an average density from 15.2 to 15.9 g/mL. A piece of 18K white gold has a density from 14.7 to 16.9 g/mL.\r\nAny 22K piece of gold has a density around 17.7 to 17.8 g/mL. Purchase a gold-testing kit to get the acid you need for the test. Testing kits include various bottles of nitric acid for different types of gold. Some tests also include a flat rock called a touchstone you can use to scratch off some of the gold on your item. You may also see needles with samples of yellow and white gold to use as a comparison to your item.\r\nTesting kits are available online. Also, check with local jewelry stores. Most jewelers use this test for its accuracy. Create a small scratch on the gold using a sharp tool. Choose an inconspicuous location on the jewelry to make the scratch, such as underneath a clasp or an inner band. Then, use a sharp tool such as a jewelry engraver to dig into the gold. Scratch until you get underneath the top layer of gold. Expose a fresh layer of gold or any other metal underneath it.\r\nNitric acid tests require you to scratch your piece of gold. If the gold has personal value to you or you plan on keeping it, take it to a professional jeweler instead of doing the test yourself. Add a drop of nitric acid to the scratch. Put on latex gloves and work in a well-ventilated room to avoid any issues with the dangerous acid. When youre ready, look for the bottle of acid labeled for 18K gold. After setting the gold in a stainless steel container, place a drop of the acid directly on the scratch you made, then watch for it to turn a shade of green. If it turns green, you know right away your gold is fake.\r\n\r\nRegular gold does not react to the acid, so your item might be gold plated or a low-purity blend of metals.\r\nA milk-colored reaction usually indicates gold-plated sterling silver. If the acid turns gold, you have gold-plated brass. Scratch the gold on a touchstone to test its purity. If you think you might have real gold, rub it along the touchstone to create a streak of gold flakes. Add a drop of 12K, 14K, 18K, and 22K nitric acid to different parts of the streak. Check back after 20 to 40 seconds. Find the spot where the acid doesnt dissolve the gold to figure out what karat rating your item is.\r\nThe acids all increase in strength, so the acid used for 22K is stronger than the 12K one. If the 18K acid dissolves the gold but the 14K one doesnt, you know your item is probably around 14K.\r\nLet go of your fear.  A lot of people put off learning how to swim because they're afraid of drowning. While drownings do occur, most of them could have been prevented by simple safety measures.  Follow these guidelines whenever you're swimming, and the odds of drowning will decrease dramatically:
Don't swim alone. Always go swimming with one other person who is a strong swimmer, if not several other people. An area with a lifeguard is usually the best place to swim.
Don't start out swimming in moving water.  If you're learning to swim in an ocean or river, you'll need to be more aware of the motion of the water.  If you must learn to swim this way, try to make sure you're with someone who knows what he or she is doing, and be sure to read the step about getting out of a riptide or a rushing river (below).
Use proper safety gear until you have enough water experience and are reasonably comfortable in the water.
Stay within a depth you can handle.  When you're first learning how to swim, don't venture into water that's too deep for you to stand in.  That way, if something goes amiss, you can simply stand up and breathe.
Avoid swimming during inclement weather conditions. Swimming in a light rain shower should be fine, but if you see or hear a storm approaching, get out of the water immediately. This rule is to be followed regardless of how well you can swim.
Don't swim in water that's too cold.  Moving your limbs to paddle can become suddenly difficult if you're in frigid water. Get used to floating.  When you're in the water, hold on to the side of the pool or a dock, and let your legs float out behind you - they should lift easily if you let them. But, for some people, they like to sink to the bottom, while your upper body floats. Don't worry; just retry the method again. Practice doing this on your stomach and on your back, until you're used to letting half of your body float.
Try floating on your back or your stomach as soon as you're ready.  Stay in a shallow depth so that you can simply stand up if it's not working out.  It might feel weird to have water around your ears while your nose and mouth are in the air, but you'll get used to it.  For extra stability, put out your arms at a right angle so that your body is in a "T" shape. When floating for the first time, you can try taking a deep breath and then floating. If your lungs are full of air, your body will float for sure. Do this until you're more experienced. Don't panic. Always remember that you have a fallback if you're in an unmanageable depth or you simply can't move your limbs - floating on your back.  Don't flail around or start breathing quickly if you can't swim; simply lie back as flat as you can, and let the water carry you while you regain your composure. 
A good tip for floating on your back is to hold your breath and have lungs full of air. Another good tip is to stick your stomach out. Practice exhaling underwater.  While you're still in a shallow depth, take a deep breath and put your face underwater.  Slowly exhale out your nose until you're out of breath, then come back up. Bubbles should come out. You can also exhale out of your mouth, but usually in big bubbles until you finally let out a stream of bubbles.
If you're uncomfortable exhaling through your nose, you can hold it closed or wear a nose plug and exhale through your mouth. Wear goggles (optional).  Wearing goggles can help you feel more comfortable opening your eyes underwater, and might allow you to see more clearly.  Find a pair with spongy circles around the eyes and dip them in the water, so that they'll stick to your skin.  Tighten the strap around the back of your head so that the goggles fit snugly. Practice kicking your legs.  Whether you're floating on your back or still holding on to the side of the pool, you can practice kicking.  (To see how far each kick can propel you, practice it using a kickboard.  This allows you to focus on your kicking technique without worrying about keeping your head above water.)
\r\n
Try a flutter kick.  Point your toes out like a ballerina, keep your legs mostly straight, and alternate legs as you make small kicks.  You should feel the most flexion in your ankles.
Try a whip kick.  Keep your legs held tightly together from your hips to your knees, and from your knees to your ankles.  Bend your knees so that your shins come up to about a 90-degree angle, then quickly bring your shins apart and move them in a circular motion, keeping your thighs together the whole time.  (That is, trace half a circle with each leg, moving your right leg to the right and your left leg to the left.)  Bring your shins back together at the bottom of the circle, and lift them up again to restart the kick.
Try an eggbeater kick.  This kick is commonly used to tread water, and stay in a vertical position with your head and shoulders above water.  Start with your knees bent and your legs slightly wider than hip-width apart.  Then "pedal" each leg as you would on a bike, only they'll go in opposite directions: while one leg pedals "forward," the other leg should pedal "backward."  This one takes some practice to get used to, but it's handy for "resting" when your feet can't touch bottom. Learn how to do a crawl.  Crawls are great strokes to learn as a beginner, and they'll move you pretty quickly.  Here's how to do them:
\r\n
Try a backstroke first.  Float flat on your back, and do a flutter kick with your legs.  With your arms, do the "crawl" motion, lifting one arm straight into the air and keeping it straight as it re-enters the water next to your head.  Once it's underwater, bend it to bring it back to a straight position next to your side, and repeat.  Alternate arms as you swim, and try to keep your fingers together and your hands as flat as possible.
Try a front stroke (also known as a freestyle or American crawl).  Floating on your stomach, do a flutter kick with your legs and use your arms to "crawl" forward.  Bring one arm out of the water so that it's "reaching" forward, then bring it back down and use your cupped hand to "push" the water behind you.  Alternate arms.  To breathe, turn your head to one side under the arm that's currently crawling, lifting enough for you to take a breath.  Take a breath under the same arm each time, so that you're breathing once every two strokes. Tread water.  Treading water can help you catch your breath and keep your head up without actually swimming.  Do the eggbeater kick listed above, and use your hands to keep your balance by "sculling" - keep your forearms flat on the surface of the water, and imagine they're butter knives spreading on a piece of toast.  Move one arm in a clockwise circle, and the other arm in a counterclockwise circle. Use your arms to come up from the bottom. If you're below water and would like to come up, use your arms to propel yourself. Put them straight up above your head, and quickly bring them down to your sides. This should push you up a few feet. Repeat until you break the surface. Try some more advanced strokes.  Once you're more comfortable in the water, you can start learning new strokes that will move you more quickly or with less energy.  Try these:
\r\n
Learn the dolphin stroke.
The butterfly stroke .
Swim the breaststroke.
Do the sidestroke.
Try swimming laps. Try diving.  Dives can be a fun way to get into the water and start a stroke.  Start with a basic dive, and move on to more complicated swan dive, back dive, and rolling dive.
\r\n
Always make sure the water is deep enough before you dive.  At a bare minimum, the water should be 9 or 10 feet (2.7 or 3.0 m) deep; if you're a tall person, make it at least 11 or 12 feet (3.4 or 3.7 m). Know how to get out of a rip current. If you're swimming in the ocean, you might get caught in a rip current.  Knowing what to do can save your life, so try to memorize these steps before you get into the water.
\r\n
Do not panic. This is, by far, the most important step of all.  By flailing and panicking, you could actually keep yourself under the water.
Swim sideways.  Do not try to swim directly to shore or directly out further into the ocean.  Instead, try to swim in a line that's exactly parallel to the shoreline.
Swim in a stroke that allows you to breathe.  Swim with the strongest stroke you can do that also allows you plenty of room to breathe.  This might be a sidestroke, front crawl, or breaststroke.
Keep swimming until you're out of the rip current.  You might have to swim quite far before you're safely out of the rip current, but keep going.  You don't want to undo the good work you've done so far by heading for shore at the wrong time.
If possible call out for help.  If you can, motion to the lifeguard or yell "Help!" as soon as possible.  However, don't do this if it means sacrificing a breath or if you have to stop swimming - it's better to keep yourself moving. Know how to get out of a river current.  If you're caught in a river that's flowing too quickly or pushing you under, follow these steps to get out:
\r\n
Don't flail or panic.  As with a rip current, panicking and flailing your limbs can push you deeper into the water.  Try to take even breaths and remain calm.
Aim to swim diagonally toward the shoreline.  Swimming toward the shoreline at a 90-degree angle will force you to fight with the current too much, and might cause you to become exhausted quickly.  Instead, plan to get to the shoreline at a diagonal angle that goes with the current.
Don't try to swim upstream.  You'll spend too much energy for not enough results.  Only try to swim upstream if there's immediate danger downstream, such as sharp rocks or a waterfall.
If you are being rapidly carried downstream by the current, point your feet in the direction you are being carried. This may prevent you from striking your head on a rock or other obstruction."""
